# FSLIB
WIP, Switch and 3DS(Maybe soon?) FS function wrapper written in modern C++ (with some needed C) for JKSV and possible future JKSM boredom rewrite. Currently functions almost 100% to the best of my knowledge.
### Notes
* The first priority is getting JKSV fully functional using this library. JKSV's functionality will take priority over adding functions for absolutely everything. A sample/testing program is included if you want a rough idea of functions and use.

* The 3DS version uses UTF16 paths and takes a back seat to Switch.
### Why?
I wanted to. You're basically working with JKSM's original FS code only in a library and much better than I could have dreamed of creating back then.
